\chapter{Feasibility Study}


\section{Introduction}
% the working of the system, \\
% Therefore, a feasibility study of the proposed system needs to be carried out in order to:\\
% \textbullet \hspace{0.2cm} 	Provide a better understanding of the System.\\
% \textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}	Describe the outputs.\\

% There are many factors. These factors are \textbf{Economical Feasibility, Technical Feasibility and Operational Feasibility}.\\

Before building MatricsV, we needed to check if it was actually possible and worthwhile to create. We examined three key areas: cost (can we afford it?), technology (can we actually build it?), and operations (will people use it?). This study helped us understand potential problems before we started coding. We looked at what software we'd need, how much it would cost to run, and whether employees would find it helpful. The results showed that while there would be some challenges in development, the benefits of having clear data visualizations would make the effort worthwhile. Most importantly, we confirmed all the necessary technology was available.

\section{Economical Feasibility}
% Need not pay any hence the system is economically feasible.\\

It is a very important aspect to be considered while developing a project. We decided the technology based on minimum possible cost factor. All hardware and software cost has to be borne by the organization. Overall we have estimated that the benefits the organization is going to receive from the proposed system will surely overcome the initial costs and the later on running cost for system.

\section{Operational Feasibility}
% company will benefit from the system and hence the system is operationally feasible. \\
Here the training cost of the system users also considered. The cost of the training program as well as space required for implementation of system is also available and the basic computer knowledge favorable atmosphere also found and utilization of software like menu driven system , will make the system more user friendly.


% \section{Financial and Economical Feasibility}
\section{Technical Feasibility}
% % This section type your project contents 
% The economic analysis is the most used........
It include the study of function, performance and constraints that may affect the ability to achieve an acceptable system. For this feasibility study, we studiedcomplete functionality to be provided in the system, as described in the system Requirement specification, and checked if everything was possible using different typeof frontend and backend platforms.
