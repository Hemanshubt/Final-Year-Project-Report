\chapter{Feasibility Study}


\section{Introduction}
% the working of the system, \\
% Therefore, a feasibility study of the proposed system needs to be carried out in order to:\\
% \textbullet \hspace{0.2cm} 	Provide a better understanding of the System.\\
% \textbullet \hspace{0.2cm}	Describe the outputs.\\

% There are many factors. These factors are \textbf{Economical Feasibility, Technical Feasibility and Operational Feasibility}.\\

After doing the project MatricsV System, study and analysing all the existing or required functionalities of the system, the next task is to do the feasibility study for the project. All projects are feasible-given unlimited resources and infinite time. Feasibility study includes consideration of all the possible ways to provide a solution to the given problem. The proposed solution should satisfy all the user requirements and should be flexible enough so that future changes can be easily done based on the future upcoming requirements. There are many different types of feasibility. Such as Economical Feasibility, Technical Feasibility, Operational Feasibility, Schedule Feasibility and Legal Feasibility

\section{Economical Feasibility}
% Need not pay any hence the system is economically feasible.\\

It is a very important aspect to be considered while developing a project. We decided the technology based on minimum possible cost factor. All hardware and software cost has to be borne by the organization. Overall we have estimated that the benefits the organization is going to receive from the proposed system will surely overcome the initial costs and the later on running cost for system.

\section{Operational Feasibility}
% company will benefit from the system and hence the system is operationally feasible. \\
Here the training cost of the system users also considered. The cost of the training program as well as space required for implementation of system is also available and the basic computer knowledge favorable atmosphere also found and utilization of software like menu driven system , will make the system more user friendly.


% \section{Financial and Economical Feasibility}
\section{Technical Feasibility}
% % This section type your project contents 
% The economic analysis is the most used........
It include the study of function, performance and constraints that may affect the ability to achieve an acceptable system. For this feasibility study, we studiedcomplete functionality to be provided in the system, as described in the system Requirement specification, and checked if everything was possible using different typeof frontend and backend platforms.
